here i have created an api testing framework


steps to run the testcases


step-1 : install the requirements given in the requirements.txt file using the command in the cmd
            "pip install -r requirements.txt"


step-2 : open the tests folder and run the tests in the ordered way as-
            1. post request(test_1_post_method.py)
            2. get request (test_2_get_method.py)
            3. put request(test_3_put_method.py)
            4. delete request(test_4_delete_method.py)

NOTE : update the json data file after completion of test scripts execution because the previous data get stored in the database by running DataGenerator.py file using the command in the cmd.
            "python DataGenerator.py"
